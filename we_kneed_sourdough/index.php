                <div class="health-benifits_content">
                    <p>Real sourdough bread is fermented for a very long time (anything from 6 to 48 hours!) During this time, the sugars and starches in the flour/dough break down considerably, and are consumed by the natural yeasts and bacteria found in the sourdough mixture. Because the fermentation time is so long, the sugars and starches have enough time to break down and be consumed. This is what makes it possible for sourdough bread to have a lower Glycemic Index.</p>
                    <p>If you’re concerned about keeping your sugar levels steady, sourdough bread may be an excellent alternative to conventional bread. The lower Glycemic Index means you sourdough will keep you fuller for longer, and help maintain steady blood sugar levels.</p>

                    <p>Sourdough bread uses natural yeasts found in its sourdough starter to make it rise. But the sourdough starter is not just full of natural yeasts, it’s also bursting with millions of friendly bacteria (probiotics) which are good for your gut (similar to those found in bio-active yoghurts, only more diverse!).</p>
                    <p>Another propety within sourdough bread is an indigestible fiber known as prebiotics. This is essentially a type of fiber that feeds the good bacteria in your gut. And a healthy gut usually means a healthy body. Prebiotics also make sourdough bread easier for the body to digest. Win win!</p>

                    <p>The long fermentation process in sourdough bread breaks down phytic acid in the dough which is an anti-nutirent. In fact, if fermented for long enough, it can almost eliminate phytic acid completely, which unlocks all of those lovely nutrients and makes them available to our bodies.</p>
                    <p>Something even more fascinating is this. Not only does sourdough bread unlock the nutrition from the wheat and make it available to our bodies, but the friendly bacteria and yeasts available in sourdough actually increases the nutrition in the wheat as a by product of the fermentation process! This works in a similar way to how other fermented foods such as kimchi and saurkraut develop increased nutritional value through fermentation.</p>

                    <p>As long as you are eating real sourdough bread, you are eating only 3 simple ingredients: flour, water and salt. Nothing else. There are no chemicals, preservatives, or anything nasty in sourdough bread. Commercially yeasted breads contain many additives, sweeteners and oils in addition to the simple ingredients that bread is supposed to have.</p>
